1. The project implementation is kicked off by the Implementation Manager 
    where the project dates are decided with a release plan dividing the dates 
    of the project.

2. A discussion then happens with all the Project Managers since their teams 
    would be involved in implementing the requirements.

3. The RRT is then circulated for every release among the Project Managers. 
    This RRT has information about  the Task ID's , Gap ID's  and the Project 
    Managers.

4. Project Managers request for dates from the developers regarding their 
    tasks for the release ( eg R1 ).

5. They go on a Release Plan Meeting to discuss dates with the other PM's 
    and build team regarding deliverables. The dates for this release R1 
    are decided eg - Code Freeze, Local Update, Dev Update, UAT Update, 
    Prod Update

    by the QA team, Fixing of bugs by the DEV Team, Sign Off by the QA team 
    followed by a fresh build from the build team.
